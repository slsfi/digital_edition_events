######################## ABOUT THIS SCRIPT ########################
#
# Version: 1.0.0
#
# This script is used to create links between tags and publications
# in the database.
#
# The input csv-file must not contain a header row. The first
# field on each row must be publication id, the second field is
# skipped and can contain anything, e.g. publication name. The
# following fields must contain tag information in a format
# where the legacy_id without prefix is inside brackets, e.g.
# mjölk [10].
#
# Setup: Fill in the parameters in the .env file.
#
# Run with command line arguments:
# DEBUG
#
# DEBUG: 1 to run in debug mode which doesn't commit data to the
#   database. 0 to run in normal mode.
#
# Created by Sebastian Köhler 2022-10-28.
#
# Change log:
#   - 2022-10-28: v1.0.0
